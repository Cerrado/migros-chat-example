## Overview

This application provides a user-friendly chat interface powered by AI models from Hugging Face and vector storage from Pinecone. Use it to experiment with conversational AI or as a starting point for your own projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
- A `.env` file in the project root with all required environment variables
  - See `.env.example` for the required fields
- API Keys for:
  - **Hugging Face** - [Create an account here](https://huggingface.co/join)
    - **User permissions** - Set following permissions:
      - Make calls to Inference Providers
      - Make calls to your Inference Endpoints
  - **Pinecone** - [Create an account here](https://www.pinecone.io/)

## Installation

Ensure your terminal is set to the root of this project e.g. if you have copied it to C:/Documents/development/migros-chat-example your terminal should be pointed at that path.

```bash
cd C:/Documents/development/migros-chat-example
```

### MacOS 

1. Create a local virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
